Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

Analyzed travel preferences among Northeastern U.S. residents (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey) for destinations like Florida, Southern California, Las Vegas, and Europe. Using cleaned datasets, Python models, and Tableau dashboards, I uncovered key trends that offer insights into destination-specific interests and demographics, supporting data-driven decisions for targeted AAA marketing efforts.
