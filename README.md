### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSk_yCDkpjJYDPJ-jc2NA9IyCnGmBzAWEFUWYJdZRkCUD6P7RU1gq0eAulqOn4RXTc7weZdqjkrTkpE/pub)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
